# CC: Pen Testing

From https://tryhackme.com/room/ccpentesting

## Nmap

Nmap is one of the most important tools in a pen testers arsenal. It  allows a pen tester to see which ports are open, and information about  which services are running on those ports.

```bash
nmap -p21,22,53,80 -sC --script=http-title -sV 10.10.10.1
```





## Netcat

Netcat aka nc is an extremely versatile tool. It allows users to connect to specific ports and send and receive data. It also allows machines to receive data and connections on specific ports, which makes nc a very  popular tool to gain a Reverse Shell

```bash
nc -l 8080
```



## Gobuster

One of the main problems of web penetration testing is not knowing where anything is. Basic reconnaissance can tell you where some files and  directories are; however, some of the more hidden stuff is often hidden  away from the eyes of users. This is where gobuster comes in, the idea  behind gobuster is that it tries to find valid directories from a  wordlist of possible directories. gobuster can also be used to valid  subdomains using the same method.



```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gobuster
```

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://domain.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -e -u http://10.10.116.74/secret/ -x "xxa,txt,html" -t 40
```



## Nikto

Nikto is a popular web scanning tool that allows users to find common  web vulnerabilities. It is commonly used to check for common CVE's such  as shellshock, and to get general information about the web server that  you're enumerating. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sullo/nikto
cd nikto/program
./nikto.pl -h http://www.example.com
```





## Metasploit

Metasploit is one of the most popular penetration testing frameworks  around. It contains a large database of almost every major CVE, which  you can easily use against a machine. The aim of this section is to go  through some of the major features of metasploit, and at the end there  will be a machine that you will need to exploit. 



## Hashcat

Hashcat is another one of the most popular hash cracking tools. It is  renowned for its versatility and speed. Hashcat does not have auto  detection for hashtypes, instead it has modes. For example if you were  trying to crack an md5 hash the "mode" would be 0, while if you were  trying to crack a sha1 hash, the mode would be 100.

A full list of all modes can be found [here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes).



## Join The Ripper

John The Ripper(jtr) is one of the best hash cracking tools  available. It supports numerous formats of hashes and is extremely easy  to use, while having a lot of options for customization. 



## Sqlmap

Sqlmap is arguably the most popular automated SQL injection tool out  there. It checks for various types of injections, and has plenty of  customization options.



## Smbmap

Smbmap is one of the best ways to enumerate samba. smbmap allows  pen-testers to run commands(given proper permissions), download and  upload files, and overall is just incredibly useful for smb enumeration.

```bash
smbmap -u "admin" -p "password" -h 10.10.10.10 -x "ipconfig"
```



## Smbclient

Smbclient allows you to do most of the things you can do with smbmap, and it also offers you and interactive prompt.

Download file: get

Upload file: put



Impacket is a collection of extremely useful windows scripts. It is  worth mentioning here, as it has many scripts available that use samba  to enumerate and even gain shell access to windows machines. All scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket).



## Privilege escalation

privilege escalation is such a large topic that it would be  impossible to do it proper justice in this type of room. However, it is a necessary topic that must be covered, so rather than making a task with questions, I shall provide you all with some resources.
